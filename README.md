# Grass detection

This project will guide you through how to get started with grass detection, using Acconeer's A121 sensor.

In this repo, you will find
- data: A folder with data, used to train the model. Once you have run through the example with the supplied data, you should record you own data.
- doc: A folder with some pictures documenting the data collection process and setup.
- model_development.ipynb: A notebook guiding you through the development process, data collection, preprocessing, model definition, training, postprocessing and evaluation.

If you want to learn more about Acconeer's sensors, tools and algorithms, please visit the [Documentation site](https://docs.acconeer.com/en/latest/).

For information on what hardware to get and how to get started with the sensor, please visit [Acconeer's Innovation Lab](https://www.acconeer.com/innovation_lab/carpet-detection/).
